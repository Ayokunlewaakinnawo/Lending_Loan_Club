The project is specifically designed to analyze the loan dataset from LENDINGCLUB STATISTICS which is contained in the .csv file named “loan1.csv” , this file holds a complete loan data for all loans issued through January to December of 2018, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.), date of issued loan, loan grade, interest rate, and latest payment information among many other information as show in the columns of the file. 

At the end of analyzing and Manipulating  this data, I was able to come up with graphical charts for each of; 


Average interest rate for each month,

Total loan amount disbursed each month, 

States in the United states where most loans are funded, 

Loan count in terms of the Loan grade and 

The most common purpose of loan collection.

These new sets of data are been created out and used to create the dashboards (…by integrating the new data with Klipfolio).
